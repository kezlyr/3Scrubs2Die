# Attribute Level 20 Capstone Ideas (Draft)

Goal: One “feels legendary” capstone per attribute at **Level 20**.

Design constraints (recommended)
- Must be **strong, noticeable, and thematic**.
- Should avoid hard invalidating other builds (capstone is a reward, not a requirement).
- Prefer effects that are **broad utility** (combat + QoL), but still attribute-flavored.
- Keep it implementable with existing progression/buff systems (passive_effects, triggered_effects, buffs).

## Perception (attPerception)

### Primary idea: “Expose Weakness”
- You gain a permanent **Weakspot Mastery** bonus:
  - +X% weakspot damage with ranged weapons and spears
  - +Y% dismember chance
  - +Z% chance to **stagger** on weakspot hit
- Fantasy: “I see the seam in everything.”

### Alternates
1) **Perfect Marksmanship**
   - First shot after reloading / weapon swap has greatly increased weakspot damage and armor penetration.
2) **Hunter’s Instinct**
   - Marked targets (hit once) take increased damage from you for a short duration; refreshes on hit.
3) **Treasure Sense (Combat-Lite)**
   - Bonus lootstage and container search speed, plus increased damage to unaware enemies.

## Strength (attStrength)

### Primary idea: “Unstoppable Force”
- When you are above a stamina threshold, your melee attacks gain:
  - Increased knockdown / ragdoll chance
  - Increased block damage
  - Reduced stamina cost for power attacks
- Optional: brief self-buff on kill (e.g., 3–5s) that boosts melee speed and damage resistance.
- Fantasy: “I break the line.”

### Alternates
1) **Titan Grip**
   - Greatly reduced recoil / sway when using heavy weapons; carrying capacity boost; reduced encumbrance penalties.
2) **Brutal Momentum**
   - Consecutive melee hits ramp damage and stagger up to a cap; resets if you miss or pause.
3) **Hard Labor Legend**
   - Mining/harvesting yield increase plus tool degradation reduction; small melee damage bonus vs. stunned/knocked enemies.

## Fortitude (attFortitude)

### Primary idea: “Second Heart”
- Major survivability capstone that’s always on (or triggers under pressure):
  - Improved health regeneration
  - Improved damage resistance when below a health threshold
  - Reduced injury/critical debuff chance (bleed, infection severity, etc.)
- Fantasy: “You simply don’t go down.”

### Alternates
1) **Adrenal Response**
   - When you take a big hit, gain a short buff: damage reduction + stamina regen + movement speed.
2) **Iron Blood**
   - Significant bleed resistance, reduced DOT damage, and faster recovery from status effects.
3) **Pain is Fuel**
   - Missing health converts to bonus melee/ranged damage (capped) and increased stamina regen.

## Agility (attAgility)

### Primary idea: “Ghost Step”
- Stealth + mobility capstone:
  - Greatly reduced noise/visibility while moving
  - Increased sneak damage (or first-hit damage) and faster movement while crouched
  - Reduced fall damage and/or improved stamina efficiency while sprinting
- Fantasy: “You move like a rumor.”

### Alternates
1) **Bullet Time Reflexes**
   - After a kill or near-miss, gain a short buff: reload speed + weapon handling + move speed.
2) **Assassin’s Chain**
   - Sneak kills refresh stamina and grant a brief crit/weakspot bonus; encourages clean takedowns.
3) **Parkour Mastery++**
   - A final step up from vanilla: no sprain/break from falls up to a higher threshold, plus jump stamina cost reduction.

---

## Intellect (attIntellect)

### Primary idea: “Mastermind”
- Crafting + utility + tech capstone:
  - Faster crafting/repair, reduced resource costs, and increased XP from crafting (or better quality floor/ceiling)
  - Trader bonuses (better prices / quest rewards) OR automated turret/robotic performance boost
- Fantasy: “You win before the fight starts.”

### Alternates
1) **Overclock**
   - Powered traps, turrets, and robots gain a major performance boost (rate of fire, damage, durability), with a small drawback like increased heat/noise.
2) **Efficient Engineer**
   - Significant reduction in workstation fuel use and crafting time; bonus to electrical trap damage.
3) **Silver Tongue Legend**
   - Strong barter bonus, extra quest choice, and improved trader secret stash / special loot chance.

## Notes for picking final capstones
- If you want **pure combat**, pick: Perception “Expose Weakness”, Strength “Unstoppable Force”, Fortitude “Second Heart”, Agility “Ghost Step”.
- If you want **hybrid combat + economy**, put more weight into Intellect’s Trader/crafting capstone and Perception’s loot/awareness alternate.
- If you want **big moments**, prefer capstones that trigger as buffs (on kill, on hit, below health threshold) rather than flat always-on stats.
