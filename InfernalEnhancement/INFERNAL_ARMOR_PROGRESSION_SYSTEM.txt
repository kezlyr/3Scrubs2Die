                    INFERNAL ARMOR PROGRESSION SYSTEM
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

OVERVIEW:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
The Infernal Armor system has been redesigned to use a single-tier crafting
system with BDO-style enhancement progression.

ACQUISITION SYSTEM:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• All Infernal Armor pieces are CRAFTING-ONLY (no longer found in loot)
• Each armor piece costs 500 Black Stones to craft
• All crafted armor is Quality 6 (Q6) - no quality tiers 1-5
• Crafted at Workbench
• 15 armor sets × 4 pieces = 60 total craftable armor pieces

PROGRESSION SYSTEM:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Base armor: Q6 +0 enhancement (crafted)
• Enhancement levels: +0 to +10 (11 total levels)
• Enhancement is the ONLY progression system
• Players collect different armor SETS for different playstyles
• Each set provides unique passive bonuses

ENHANCEMENT MECHANICS:

  - Each failstack increases success rate by 1%
  - Failstacks reset to 0 on successful enhancement
  - Failstacks are player-wide (not per-item)

• Regression on failure:
