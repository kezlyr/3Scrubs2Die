ASYLUM SPECIAL ANIMALS - RESOURCES FOLDER
=========================================

This folder should contain the Unity3D asset files for Asylum Special Animals:

CROCODILE:
Required file: crocodile.unity3d

The Unity3D file should contain:
- Crocodile (the main crocodile prefab)
- All textures, materials, and animations for the crocodile creature

The entity class configuration in entityclasses.xml references:
Mesh value="#@modfolder:Resources/crocodile.unity3d?Crocodile"

Make sure the prefab name in the Unity3D file matches "Crocodile" exactly.

FUTURE ANIMALS:
This mod is designed to support multiple special animals. Additional Unity3D files
can be added here for future creatures following the same naming convention.
