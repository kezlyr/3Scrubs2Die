Resource Sinks
    New Ammo Types
    Endgame alloy repair kits (Apex/Smeltercore as ingredients)
    “Catalyst” consumables for forges/benches (burns per craft batch)
    High-tier turret ammo + turret parts that consume new metals
    Trader contract items (craft alloys -> turn-in for dukes/rep/loot)
    Crafting station "maintenance parts" (periodic repairs using alloys)
    Late-game mod rerolling (consume alloys to reroll mod stats/tiers)
    Convert excess ore into industrial slag used for concrete/asphalt
    Rare ammo component pipeline (primers/casings/powder) that eats resources

Renewable Resources
    Deep Mining Drill block?
        Mining heads that break?
        Cost to mine?
        Mining skills required!
        Mining skills adjust ore received
    Late-game “ore refinery” loop (scrap -> ingots with fuel + catalyst cost)
    Farmable crafting reagents (acid/coal/nitrate alternatives) via rare crops
    Water/food automation path (hydroponics-style blocks as a resource sink)
    Salvage loop: break down high-tier loot into alloys (with diminishing returns)
    Renewable fuel path (biofuel/oil crops) to support heavy industry crafting
    Quarry/ore processor block that converts stone -> small ore chances (slow)
    Perk-gated prospecting consumable (reveals nearby ore nodes temporarily)

Bundles
    Ammo Bundles
    Medical Supply Bundles
    Food Supply Bundles
    Building Material Bundles
    Quest reward bundles (small/large) that mirror vanilla quest bundle behavior
    Kit bundles for stations (forge kit, chem kit, farming kit) with perk gates
    Resource conversion bundles (e.g., 10x scrap -> 1x forged) as convenience sinks
    Resource scrap bundles (buy/craft bulk packs for new ore scraps)
    Trader-only “crate” bundles (expensive, high RNG, late-game sink)
    Mod bundles (random weapon/armor/tool mods; gated by perks)

Item Modifications
    Weapon Mods
    Armor Mods
    Tool Mods
    Drill/mining head mods with durability + fuel tradeoffs
    Elemental resist plating set (uses new metals; ties into your buff changes)
    Vehicle performance mods that consume alloys (torque/fuel/storage/armor)
    Tiered versions of key mods (basic/superior/advanced) using new alloys
    Industrial lubricant mod that improves tool handling but increases wear
    Armor utility mods (heat/cold/rad packages) with diminishing stacking rules

Make Oven use electricty instead of fuel.
